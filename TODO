TODO List
=========

This is a register of some things that still need to be adequately handled in this code library

1/ Multipart does not work.

This occurs when a 401 Unauthorised challenge is received.  In making the initial request, the library
reads all of the data from the input stream to be delivered, and therefore cannot re-deliver it once
authentication has taken place.


Notes
-----

- Create mechanism for handling arbitrary response codes (might act on response codes that we understand, like
302, etc); possible value in a response code handler with default behaviour that can be customised per-request

- documentation

- logging

- modify foresite to allow namespace prefixes to be passed in
